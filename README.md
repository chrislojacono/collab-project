# Ideas
* Python Web Scraping app - Build a web scraper (suggested implementation: any programming language you want to master). Build a tool that takes a URL as input and returns the content of the URL as HTML or XML.
* An expense tracker (suggested implementation: web or mobile app). Create a simple interface you can use to add and categorize your expenses. Generate monthly reports based on the inputs and write custom alerts for things, like, “spending too much money on coffee… as always.”
* An unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe engine (suggested implementation: CLI program). For an excellent first AI project, try to write an engine that cannot be beaten at Tic-Tac-Toe. You can achieve this by implementing this strategy, which produces a draw as its worst-case outcome. [Strategy Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy)
